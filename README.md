# Mortality Risk by Health Factors
## Description
This project conducts an analysis of causes of death spanning from 1999 to 2019 across different countries, utilizing data sourced from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. This examination aims to uncover prevalent diseases, risk factors, and healthcare disparities, providing insights into global public health trends over time.

## Code
1. The 'project.ipynb' file contains comprehensive code encompassing feature selection, data visualization, PCA, classification, and regression tasks, also available as a published PDF for ease of reference.

2. The 'loaddataset.py' file provides clear instructions on how to load the dataset from Kaggle.

3. The 'preliminaryanalysis.ipynb' file conducts initial analysis on the entire dataset, preparing it for subsequent use in the main codebase.
